    <br> Hi! Again I'm Jasmine Suniga Kasilag but you can call me jass Barangay Bagong pook Lipa, City, Batangas. I am 19 years old. My love for CS began in high school when I stumbled upon a captivating documentary that opened my eyes to the endless possibilities within this field. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to delve deeper into understanding more about in computer science and its impact on the world around us. Transitioning to college has been an exciting adventure. The first few weeks were a whirlwind of new faces, challenging courses, and morning study sessions. Despite the initial jitters, I quickly found a supportive group of friends who share my enthusiasm for being a good programmer. <br>
    
    <br> As a second year college student, I'm still navigating the ins and outs of college life, but I'm eager to face the challenges ahead. My goal is to not only excel in my studies but also to contribute positively to the college community. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and the opportunities for learning and growth that lie ahead. I look forward to the adventures that await me in the next three years of college and the opportunity to discover more about myself and the ever-evolving world of Computer Science.
